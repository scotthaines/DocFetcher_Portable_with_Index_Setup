1.  Start with a Gimp 2 source file for another 
    Windows .ico file if you have such a .xcf file.

2.  Create the layers of the ico file in Gimp 2.
    Here it is
        DFP_256_by_256.xcf

3.  Resize the image in the file above to create
        DFP_016_by_016.xcf

4.  File export as .png along with image resizing
    for the 048 by 048 file to create
        DFP_256_256_blue.png
        DFP_048_048_blue.png
        DFP_016_016_blue.png
    from the above two .xcf files.

5.  Create the
        DFP_blue.xcf
    file from the above three .png files.

6.  File export as .ico the
        docfetcher_portable_blue.ico
    file from the 
        DFP_blue.xcf
    file created earlier.

    This step is shown in 
        DFP_blue.xcf_-_10_file_export_from_here_to_ico_file.png
    and
        DFP_blue.xcf_-_20_file_export_settings_that_work_to_create_ico_file.png
